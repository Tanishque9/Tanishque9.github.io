                    <p>Right from my school days, I had strong proclivity towards Science and Mathematics, which eventually helped me get into the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). I chose Material science as my major. In Material Science I got to work in the fields of characterization, mechanical behavior of materials, corrosion, computational process design etc. Besides my major in Material Science I also explored other courses like NLP, Data structure and Algorithms, ML, Entrepreneurship, Marketing, Design etc. This helped me improve and expand my thinking and not just sticking to a particular domain. <br /><br />Right now I am in my final year of B.Tech in Material Science with minor in Computer Science. I am eager to work and apply what I have learnt. Would surely love to connect with new people, so feel free to contact.</p>
